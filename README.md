# beyonce-app

This is a small Vue app to display beyonce's albums, I created this app in an attempt to learn Vue. You can filter albums by CollectionName(album name). The library used are axios and vuetify.
The react version of this app can be found at [Beyonce-app](https://github.com/AKFessha/beyonce-app/tree/solution) repo
